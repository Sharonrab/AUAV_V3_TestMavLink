The SLUGS2 (extendable Santa Cruz Low-cost UAV GNC System) is a hardware and software upgrade from the previous Auto-Pilot full-scale product. 
The development relies on a Rapid Prototyping model (Developed in the Autonomous System Lab at UCSC). 
The Auto-Pilot is a Simulink Model designed to run on the AUAV3 R5 board ([http://arsovtech.com/?p=1414]) with manageable requirements: 
MPLAB Blockset for Simulink v3.38 and a 
xc16 compiler version 1.26 ([http://www.microchip.com/SimulinkBlocks]).

This project is based upon the work of previous members of the ASL-Mariano Lizarraga & Lubin Kerhuels Blockset.
