5.20.16

1 - Converted more of the navSupport function calls.

	TODO: a number of the function calls that need to converted use a dynamic index value. Need to determine the appropriate solution to this by either keeping the existing function OR build a logic block in the model that handles this. Simulink's DataReadStore block does not handle dynamic indexes.

5.18.16

1 - Began converting all navSupport function calls that get data from mavlink
	messages to DataRead blocks. 

5.17.16

1 - Commented out a number of GoTo blocks in the model to remove the warnings generated, replaced the commented blocks with sinks. 
    These need to be sorted in the future.

2 - A demux was modified from 2 to 3 outputs for the height PID controller, the controller is actually a PI controller but the function
    call used to retrieve the gains for the controller is deisgned to return 3 variables. I've added a sink for the third (D-gain) variable.

3 - Created a config.xml file to include all the necessary directories from the XC16 compiler, mavlink, and clib.

4 - Currently incurring a build error due to model's "_data.o"
